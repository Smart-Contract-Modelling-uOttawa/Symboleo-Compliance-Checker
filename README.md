# Symboleo Text Editor
An IDE for the formal contract specification Symboleo is created using [Xtext](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/).

# What is Symboleo?
One line explanation.

# Current State
The current version of the text editor created by Xtext has implemented the syntax of Symboleo. It provides the capability to write Symboleo contract specifications more easily (autofill and syntax highlighting).

# Future Work
Static type-checking, scoping and code-generation features will be added in the future.
